This is a fork of the [trunk-recorder](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder) audioplayer.php that's been modified to work a little better.

New features include:

* Live-updating when new calls are added
* Ability to select multiple talkgroups


No idea how long I'll be interested in maintaining this
